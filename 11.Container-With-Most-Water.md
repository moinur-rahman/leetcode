# 11. Container With Most Water

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `height` of length `n`, there are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a two-pointer technique with optimization:

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - i: points to the start of array
   - j: points to the end of array
2. While i < j:
   - Calculate water area using min height × width
   - Update maximum water if current area is larger
   - Skip all lines with height less than or equal to current min height
   - Move pointers towards better potential results

### Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of array

### Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int i = 0, j = height.size() - 1;
        int water = 0;

        while (i < j) {
            int mn = min(height[i], height[j]);
            water = max(water, (j - i) * mn);

            // Skip all smaller or equal heights from left
            while (mn >= height[i] && i < j) {
                i++;
            }

            // Skip all smaller or equal heights from right
            while (mn >= height[j] && i < j) {
                j--;
            }
        }
        return water;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. Area calculation: min(height[i], height[j]) × (j - i)
2. Optimization: Skip lines that can't form larger area
3. The solution always maintains the maximum possible area
4. Moving pointers towards center ensures we don't miss any potential maximum
5. No need to check heights we've already determined are too small
