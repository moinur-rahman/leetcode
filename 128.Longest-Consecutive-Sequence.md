# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## Solution Approach: Hash Set

This solution uses a hash set to efficiently check for consecutive elements:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - We can use a hash set for O(1) lookups
   - Only start checking sequences from their starting points (numbers that have no left neighbor)

### Implementation Details

1. Insert all numbers into a hash set for O(1) lookups
2. For each number in the set:
   - Check if it's the start of a sequence (i.e., num-1 is not in the set)
   - If it is a starting point, keep checking for consecutive elements (num+1, num+2, etc.)
   - Track the length of the current sequence
   - Update the maximum sequence length found so far

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- We traverse the array once to build the hash set, and for each element, we do at most one streak calculation
- Each number is only visited once during the streak calculations
- All hash set operations are O(1)

### Space Complexity: **O(n)**

- The hash set stores at most n elements

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int ans = 0;

        for (int num : numSet) {
            if (numSet.find(num - 1) == numSet.end()) {
                int currentStreak = 0;
                while (numSet.find(num) != numSet.end()) {
                    currentStreak++;
                    num++;
                }
                ans = max(ans, currentStreak);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution only processes each number at most twice:
   - When checking if it's the start of a sequence
   - When counting it as part of a sequence
2. We only start counting from numbers that are the beginning of a sequence (no left neighbor)

   - This prevents redundant calculations and ensures O(n) time complexity

3. Using a hash set is crucial for the O(1) lookups that make this approach efficient

4. The algorithm is clever because it skips numbers that are in the middle of sequences, focusing only on sequence beginnings
