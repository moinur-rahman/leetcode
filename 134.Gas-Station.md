# 134. Gas Station

## Problem Description

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i`-th station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i`-th station to its next `(i + 1)`-th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

## Solution

The solution involves iterating through the gas stations and calculating the total gas and cost. If at any point the current tank of gas becomes negative, it means that the journey cannot be completed starting from the previous starting station. Thus, we reset the starting station to the next station and reset the current tank to zero. If the total gas is greater than or equal to the total cost, then the journey can be completed, and we return the starting station. Otherwise, we return `-1`.

## Notes
1. There is a unique solution.
2. As there is a unique solution, so we will found exactly one starting station.
3. Total gas should be greater than or equal to the total cost to complete the journey.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution
{
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int> &gas, vector<int> &cost)
    {
        int n = gas.size();

        int total_gas = 0;
        int total_cost = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            total_gas += gas[i];
            total_cost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (tank < 0)
            {
                start = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }

        if (total_gas < total_cost)
        {

            return -1;
        }
        else
        {
            return start;
        }
    }
};
```
