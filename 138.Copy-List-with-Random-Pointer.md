# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

## Problem Description

A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

## Solution Approach: Interweave, Link, and Extract

This solution uses a three-step approach to create a deep copy of a linked list with random pointers:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Create a copy of each node and interweave them with the original list
   - Link random pointers using the interweaved structure
   - Extract the copied list from the interweaved structure

### Implementation Details

1. **Interweave**: For each original node, create a copy and place it right after the original node
2. **Link Random Pointers**: Use the interweaved structure to easily find the random pointer targets
3. **Extract**: Separate the interweaved list into original and copied lists

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- Where n is the length of the linked list
- Each step traverses the list once, resulting in O(n) time complexity

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- Only constant extra space is used (excluding the space for the output)
- No hash maps or additional data structures needed

## Code Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 * class Node {
 * public:
 *     int val;
 *     Node* next;
 *     Node* random;
 *
 *     Node(int _val) {
 *         val = _val;
 *         next = NULL;
 *         random = NULL;
 *     }
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        Node* curr = head;

        while (curr != nullptr) {
            Node* copy = new Node(curr->val);
            copy->next = curr->next;
            curr->next = copy;
            curr = copy->next;
        }

        curr = head;

        while (curr != nullptr) {
            if (curr->random) {
                curr->next->random = curr->random->next;
            }
            curr = curr->next->next;
        }

        curr = head;
        Node* dummy = new Node(0);
        Node* copyCurr = dummy;

        while (curr != nullptr) {
            copyCurr->next = curr->next;
            curr->next = curr->next->next;

            curr = curr->next;
            copyCurr = copyCurr->next;
        }

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

### Alternative Solution: Hash Map Approach

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 * class Node {
 * public:
 *     int val;
 *     Node* next;
 *     Node* random;
 *
 *     Node(int _val) {
 *         val = _val;
 *         next = NULL;
 *         random = NULL;
 *     }
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        Node* curr = head;

        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> mp;

        while (curr != nullptr) {
            mp[curr] = new Node(curr->val);
            curr = curr->next;
        }

        curr = head;
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            Node* copy = mp[curr];
            copy->next = mp[curr->next];
            copy->random = mp[curr->random];

            curr = curr->next;
        }

        return mp[head];
    }
};
```

#### Hash Map Approach Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Two passes through the list
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Extra space for the hash map
- **Trade-off**: Simpler implementation at the cost of extra space

## Notes

1. The first solution uses a three-phase approach to efficiently copy the list:

   - Phase 1: Create interweaved list (A → A' → B → B' → C → C')
   - Phase 2: Set random pointers using the interleaving pattern
   - Phase 3: Separate the original and copied lists

2. Advantages of this approach:

   - No extra space for hash maps to track node relationships
   - Linear time complexity (O(n))
   - Handles all edge cases including empty lists

3. Edge cases handled:
   - Works correctly when the list is empty
   - Properly handles NULL random pointers
   - Preserves all connections correctly in the deep copy
