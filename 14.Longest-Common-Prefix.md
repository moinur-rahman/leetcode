# 14. Longest Common Prefix

## Problem Description

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

## Approach

1. Initialize an empty string `ans` to store the longest common prefix.
2. Iterate through the characters of the first string.
3. For each character, check if it is present at the same position in all other strings.
4. If a mismatch is found, break the loop.
5. Append the character to `ans` if it matches in all strings.
6. Return `ans` as the longest common prefix.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        int len = strs.size();
        string ans = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < strs[0].size(); i++) {

            int flag = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j < strs.size(); j++) {

                if (i >= strs[j].size() || strs[0][i] != strs[j][i]) {
                    flag = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (flag) {
                break;
            }
            ans += strs[0][i];
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n \* m) where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string.
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Examples

- Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
  Output: "fl"
  Explanation: The longest common prefix is "fl".

- Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
  Output: ""
  Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
