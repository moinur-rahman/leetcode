# 141. Linked List Cycle

## Problem Description

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.

## Solution Approach: Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm (Fast and Slow Pointers)

This solution uses the Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Use two pointers moving at different speeds
   - If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer
   - If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list

### Implementation Details

1. Initialize two pointers (slow and fast) at the head
2. Move slow pointer one step and fast pointer two steps at a time
3. If they meet, there's a cycle
4. If fast reaches null, there's no cycle

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- In the worst case, we might need to traverse the entire list

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- We only use two pointers regardless of the input size

## Code Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head) {
            return false;
        }

        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;

        while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;

            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution efficiently detects cycles:

   - Slow pointer moves one step at a time
   - Fast pointer moves two steps at a time
   - If they meet, there must be a cycle

2. Important considerations:
   - Initial null check prevents accessing null pointer
   - The algorithm works because if there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer
   - If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end (null)
