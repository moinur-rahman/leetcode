# 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

## Problem Description

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Note that:

- Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
- The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there won't be any division by zero operation.

## Solution Approach: Using Stack

This solution uses a stack to efficiently evaluate the Reverse Polish Notation expression:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Use a stack to store operands
   - When encountering an operator, pop the two most recent operands, apply the operation, and push the result back

### Implementation Details

1. Process each token in the array:
   - If it's a number, push it onto the stack
   - If it's an operator, pop two values, perform the operation, and push the result back
2. The final answer will be the only element left in the stack

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- We process each token in the array exactly once

### Space Complexity: **O(n)**

- In the worst case, the stack could store all operands in the input array

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int evalRPN(vector<string>& tokens) {
        if (tokens.size() == 1) {
            return stoi(tokens[0]);
        }
        stack<int> number;

        int ans = 0;
        for (string c : tokens) {
            if (c == "+" || c == "-" || c == "*" || c == "/") {
                int b = number.top();
                number.pop();
                int a = number.top();
                number.pop();
                if (c == "+") {
                    ans = a + b;
                } else if (c == "-") {
                    ans = a - b;
                } else if (c == "*") {
                    ans = a * b;
                } else if (c == "/") {
                    ans = a / b;
                }

                number.push(ans);
            } else {
                number.push(stoi(c));
            }
        }

        return number.top();
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution efficiently handles the evaluation:

   - Each operator works on the two most recent values in the stack
   - The stack naturally maintains the order of operations according to RPN rules

2. Important considerations:

   - We handle integer division truncation as required by the problem
   - The approach correctly manages the order of operands for non-commutative operations like subtraction and division
   - Order matters: the first popped element (b) is the second operand, the second popped element (a) is the first operand

3. Edge case:
   - When only one token is provided, it's the final answer (no operations needed)
