# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

## Problem Description

Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a two-pointer technique:

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - left: points to the start of array
   - right: points to the end of array
2. While left pointer is less than right pointer:
   - Calculate sum of numbers at left and right
   - If sum equals target, return indices + 1 (1-based indexing)
   - If sum is greater than target, decrease right pointer
   - If sum is less than target, increase left pointer

### Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of array

### Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        vector<int> ans;

        int left = 0, right = numbers.size() - 1;

        int total;

        while (left < right) {
            total = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

            if (total == target) {
                ans.push_back(left + 1);
                ans.push_back(right + 1);
                break;
            } else if (total > target) {
                right--;
            } else {
                left++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Alternative Solution - Hash Map Approach

This solution uses a hash map to store previously seen numbers:

1. Create an unordered map to store number-to-index mapping
2. Iterate through the array:
   - Check if (target - current number) exists in map
   - If yes, we found our pair
   - If no, add current number and its index to map

### Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of array

### Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the hash map

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int len = numbers.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        vector<int> ans;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (mp[target - numbers[i]]) {
                ans.push_back(mp[target - numbers[i]]);
                ans.push_back(i + 1);
            } else if (!mp[numbers[i]]) {
                mp[numbers[i]] = i + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

Note: While this solution also works with O(n) time complexity, it uses O(n) extra space compared to the two-pointer approach. Since the input array is already sorted, the two-pointer solution is more optimal for this specific problem.

## Notes

1. Input array must be sorted in non-decreasing order
2. Solution is guaranteed to exist
3. Each input has exactly one solution
4. Same element cannot be used twice
5. Return value is 1-indexed
