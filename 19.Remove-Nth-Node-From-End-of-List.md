# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Solution Approach: Two Pointer Technique

This solution uses the two-pointer technique to find and remove the nth node from the end:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Use two pointers (fast and slow) separated by n nodes
   - When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the node before the one to be deleted

### Implementation Details

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Create a dummy node and set both pointers to it
2. **Advance Fast**: Move fast pointer n nodes ahead
3. **Move Both**: Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
4. **Remove Node**: Skip the nth node from the end

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- Where n is the length of the linked list
- Single pass through the list

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- Only uses a constant amount of extra space

## Solution: Two Pointer Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode* fast = dummy;
        ListNode* slow = dummy;

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }

        while (fast != nullptr) {
            fast = fast->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        ListNode* nodeToDelete = slow->next;
        slow->next = nodeToDelete->next;

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution handles all edge cases:
   - Works when removing the first node (n equals length of list)
   - Works when removing the last node (n = 1)
   - Works for lists of any length
2. Using a dummy node simplifies edge cases:
   - Avoids special handling when removing the head
   - Provides a consistent starting point for both pointers
