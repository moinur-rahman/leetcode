# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Solution Approach: Two Pointer Technique

This solution uses the two-pointer technique to find and remove the nth node from the end:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Use two pointers (fast and slow) separated by n nodes
   - When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the node before the one to be deleted

### Implementation Details

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Create a dummy node and set both pointers to it
2. **Advance Fast**: Move fast pointer n nodes ahead
3. **Move Both**: Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
4. **Remove Node**: Skip the nth node from the end

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- Where n is the length of the linked list
- Single pass through the list

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- Only uses a constant amount of extra space

## Solution: Two Pointer Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode* fast = dummy;
        ListNode* slow = dummy;

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }

        while (fast != nullptr) {
            fast = fast->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        ListNode* nodeToDelete = slow->next;
        slow->next = nodeToDelete->next;

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

## Alternative Solution: Count and Remove Approach

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode* ans = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode* pre = ans;
        ListNode* curr = ans;

        int total_node = 0;

        while (pre != nullptr) {
            pre = pre->next;
            total_node++;
        }

        int target_index = total_node - n + 1;

        int i = 1;
        while (curr != nullptr && i < target_index - 1) {
            curr = curr->next;
            i++;
        }

        ListNode* previous_node = curr;
        ListNode* next_node = curr->next->next;
        if (next_node == nullptr) {
            previous_node->next = nullptr;
        } else {
            previous_node->next = next_node;
        }

        return ans->next;
    }
};
```

This approach:

1. First counts the total number of nodes
2. Calculates the target node's position from the start
3. Traverses to the node just before the target
4. Removes the target node by updating pointers

Time Complexity: O(n) - requires two passes through the list
Space Complexity: O(1) - only uses a constant amount of extra space

## Notes

1. The solution handles all edge cases:
   - Works when removing the first node (n equals length of list)
   - Works when removing the last node (n = 1)
   - Works for lists of any length
2. Using a dummy node simplifies edge cases:
   - Avoids special handling when removing the head
   - Provides a consistent starting point for both pointers
