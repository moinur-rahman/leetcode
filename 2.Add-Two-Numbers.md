# 2. Add Two Numbers

## Problem Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Solution Approach: Iterative Addition with Carry

This solution simulates the grade-school addition algorithm but with linked lists:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Process both lists simultaneously, node by node
   - Keep track of carry value between additions
   - Create a new linked list to store the result

### Implementation Details

1. Initialize a dummy head node for the result list
2. Traverse both lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits
3. Handle the carry for each addition operation
4. Continue until both lists are processed and no carry remains

### Time Complexity: **O(max(m,n))**

- Where m and n are the lengths of the two linked lists

### Space Complexity: **O(max(m,n))**

- For storing the result linked list

## Code Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode *head = nullptr, *ans = nullptr;

        int carry = 0;

        while (l1 != nullptr || l2 != nullptr || carry) {
            int sum = carry;
            if (l1 != nullptr) {
                sum += l1->val;
                l1 = l1->next;
            }
            if (l2 != nullptr) {
                sum += l2->val;
                l2 = l2->next;
            }
            int digit = sum % 10;
            carry = sum / 10;

            ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(digit);
            if (head == nullptr) {
                head = newNode;
                ans = newNode;
            } else {
                head->next = newNode;
                head = head->next;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution handles different length lists naturally:

   - We continue iteration until both lists are processed and no carry remains
   - For a shorter list, we treat missing nodes as having value 0

2. Edge cases handled:
   - The algorithm works when lists have different lengths
   - It correctly propagates the carry to create an additional node if needed
   - Works with single-digit inputs
