# 20. Valid Parentheses

## Problem Description

Given a string s containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Solution Approach: Stack-based Validation

This solution uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and validate closing brackets:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Use a stack to store opening brackets as we encounter them
   - When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the most recent opening bracket

### Implementation Details

1. Create a stack to store opening brackets
2. Create a mapping from opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets
3. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
   - If it's a closing bracket:
     - Check if stack is empty (no matching opening bracket) → return false
     - Check if the top of the stack has a matching opening bracket → return false if mismatch
     - Pop the matched opening bracket from the stack
4. After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if all brackets were properly matched

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- We iterate through the string once, performing O(1) operations for each character

### Space Complexity: **O(n)**

- In the worst case, the stack could contain all characters (if all are opening brackets)

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValid(string s) {
        stack<char> st;

        unordered_map<char, char> matching;
        matching['('] = ')';
        matching['{'] = '}';
        matching['['] = ']';

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == '(' || s[i] == '{' || s[i] == '[') {
                st.push(s[i]);
            } else {
                if (st.empty() || matching[st.top()] != s[i]) {
                    return false;
                }
                st.pop();
            }
        }

        return st.empty();
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution handles three key edge cases:

   - Empty string: Returns true (stack remains empty)
   - String with only closing brackets: Returns false (stack is empty when processing closing bracket)
   - Unmatched brackets: Returns false (either through mismatch or non-empty stack at the end)

2. Using an unordered_map provides a clean way to check matching brackets with O(1) lookup time

3. The final check `return st.empty()` ensures all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets
