# 202. Happy Number

## Problem Description

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

## Solution Approach: Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare)

This solution uses Floyd's cycle detection algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm) to determine if a number is happy:

1. **Cycle Detection Strategy**:
   - If a number is happy, the sequence will eventually reach 1.
   - If a number is not happy, the sequence will eventually enter a cycle.
   - We use two pointers moving at different speeds to detect cycles.

### Implementation Details

1. Define a helper function `getNext(n)` to compute the sum of squares of digits.
2. Initialize two pointers:
   - `slow` pointer that moves one step at a time
   - `fast` pointer that moves two steps at a time
3. If the number is happy, `fast` will reach 1.
4. If the number is not happy, `slow` and `fast` will eventually meet in the cycle.

### Time Complexity: **O(log n)**

- The number of digits in a number n is log n
- Each iteration of digit processing takes O(log n) time
- The cycle detection terminates in at most O(log n) steps

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- We use constant extra space regardless of the input size

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getNext(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            int rem = (n % 10);
            sum += rem * rem;
            n /= 10;
        }

        return sum;
    }
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        int slow = getNext(n);
        int fast = getNext(getNext(n));

        while (slow != fast && fast != 1) {
            slow = getNext(slow);
            fast = getNext(getNext(fast));
        }

        return fast == 1;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution uses **Floyd's Cycle Detection** algorithm to efficiently detect cycles.
2. A number is happy if the process terminates at 1.
3. A number is unhappy if the process enters a cycle that doesn't include 1.
4. For unhappy numbers, the algorithm will detect when the sequence starts cycling.
5. The time complexity is logarithmic relative to the input value.
