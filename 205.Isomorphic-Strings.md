# 205. Isomorphic Strings

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a mapping approach with two hash maps:

1. Create a hash map `mp` to track the mapping from characters in `s` to characters in `t`
2. Create a hash map `used` to keep track of which characters in `t` have already been mapped to
3. Iterate through both strings simultaneously:
   - If a character in `s` is not mapped yet:
     - Check if the corresponding character in `t` is already used; if yes, return false
     - Otherwise, create the mapping
   - If a character in `s` is already mapped:
     - Check if the mapping is consistent with the current character in `t`; if not, return false
4. Return true if all checks pass

### Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the strings

### Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the size of the character set

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, char> mp;
        unordered_map<char, int> used;

        int len = s.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (mp.find(s[i]) == mp.end()) {
                if (used[t[i]] > 0) {
                    return false;
                }
                mp[s[i]] = t[i];
            } else {
                if (mp[s[i]] != t[i]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            used[t[i]]++;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution ensures that each character in `s` maps to exactly one character in `t`
2. The `used` hash map prevents multiple characters in `s` from mapping to the same character in `t`
3. Time complexity is linear as we only need to iterate through the strings once
4. The problem requires maintaining both the forward mapping (sâ†’t) and ensuring no two characters map to the same character
