# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

## Problem Description

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

## Solution Approach: Iterative Merge

This solution uses a straightforward iterative approach to merge the two sorted linked lists:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Create a dummy node to simplify handling the head of the result list
   - Compare nodes from both lists and always take the smaller one
   - Append remaining nodes when one list is exhausted

### Implementation Details

1. Create a dummy node and a tail pointer to build the result list
2. Compare nodes from both lists and attach the smaller one to the result
3. Move the tail pointer and the pointer of the list we took the node from
4. When one list is exhausted, append all remaining nodes from the other list

### Time Complexity: **O(n+m)**

- Where n and m are the lengths of the two linked lists

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- Only constant extra space is used regardless of input size
- Note: The output list is not counted in the space complexity

## Code Implementation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        ListNode dummy;
        ListNode* tail = &dummy;

        while (list1 != nullptr && list2 != nullptr) {

            if (list1->val <= list2->val) {
                tail->next = new ListNode(list1->val);
                list1 = list1->next;
            } else {
                tail->next = new ListNode(list2->val);
                list2 = list2->next;
            }
            tail = tail->next;
        }

        tail->next = list1 ? list1 : list2;

        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution efficiently merges the two lists:

   - Uses a dummy head node to avoid edge cases for the first node
   - Always selects the smaller value between the two lists
   - Appends remaining nodes from whichever list is not exhausted

2. Alternative implementation:

   - Instead of creating new nodes, we could reuse existing nodes by rewiring pointers
   - This would save memory but the provided solution is simpler to understand

3. Edge cases handled:
   - Works correctly when either or both lists are empty
   - Works with lists of different lengths
