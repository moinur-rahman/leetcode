# 219. Contains Duplicate II

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.

## Solution Approach: Sliding Window with Hash Map

This solution uses a sliding window approach with a hash map to track element occurrences:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - We need to find duplicates within a window of size `k+1`
   - A hash map can track the frequency of elements within the current window

### Implementation Details

1. Use an `unordered_map` to store the count of each number in the current window
2. Iterate through the array:
   - Add the current number to the window (increment its count in the map)
   - If we've processed more than `k+1` elements, remove the element that falls outside the window
   - Check if the count of the current number is at least 2 (a duplicate within the window)
3. Return `true` if a duplicate is found within the window, otherwise `false`

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- We traverse the array once, with constant-time hash map operations

### Space Complexity: **O(min(n, k))**

- The hash map stores at most `min(n, k)` elements (the size of the sliding window)

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsNearbyDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            count[nums[i]]++;
            if (i - k - 1 >= 0) {
                count[nums[i - k - 1]]--;
            }

            if(count[nums[i]] >= 2){
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution maintains a sliding window of size at most `k+1`
2. The hash map tracks the frequency of each element within the window
3. If any element appears more than once within the window, it means we found two indices `i` and `j` such that:
   - `nums[i] == nums[j]`
   - `|i - j| <= k`
4. The implementation efficiently handles window updates by decrementing counts of elements falling outside the window
