# 228. Summary Ranges

## Problem Description

You are given a sorted unique integer array `nums`.

Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

- `"a->b"` if `a != b`
- `"a"` if `a == b`

## Solution Approach: Linear Traversal

This solution uses a single pass through the sorted array to identify consecutive sequences:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the array is sorted, we can identify ranges by checking if the next element is consecutive
   - We maintain the start of a range and extend it as long as we find consecutive elements

### Implementation Details

1. Iterate through the array
2. For each number, check if it's the start of a range
3. If it is, track the range until we find a non-consecutive element
4. Format the range as required ("a" or "a->b") and add it to the result
5. Skip the elements that have already been included in a range

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- We traverse the array only once
- Each element is processed exactly once

### Space Complexity: **O(1)** (excluding output)

- We only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size
- The output size varies but isn't counted in space complexity analysis

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> summaryRanges(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<string> ans;
        int len = nums.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            string s = to_string(nums[i]);
            bool flag = 0;
            while (i + 1 < len && (nums[i] + 1) == nums[i + 1]) {
                i++;
                flag = 1;
            }
            if (flag) {
                s += "->" + to_string(nums[i]);
            }

            ans.push_back(s);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution efficiently identifies ranges in a single pass through the array
2. We use a flag to track whether we found a range or just a single number
3. The string formatting correctly handles both cases: single numbers and ranges
4. The solution takes advantage of the fact that the input array is sorted and contains unique elements
5. Special care is taken with the loop index when we find a range (we increment `i` inside the while loop)
