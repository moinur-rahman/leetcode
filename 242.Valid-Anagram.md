# 242. Valid Anagram

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a hash map approach:

1. First, check if both strings have the same length. If not, they cannot be anagrams.
2. Create an unordered_map to track the frequency of each character in string `s`
3. Iterate through the first string and increment the frequency count for each character
4. Iterate through the second string:
   - For each character, check if it exists in our map and has a frequency > 0
   - If not, return false as this means we have a character that doesn't match
   - Otherwise, decrement the frequency count for that character
5. Return true if all checks pass

### Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the strings

### Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the number of unique characters (at most 26 for lowercase English letters)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        unordered_map<char, int> mp;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            mp[s[i]]++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            if (mp[t[i]] == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            mp[t[i]]--;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. This solution efficiently checks if two strings are anagrams by comparing character frequencies
2. The initial length check is an optimization that quickly rules out strings of different lengths
3. The hash map tracks how many of each character appear in the first string
4. When processing the second string, we ensure each character appears exactly as many times as in the first string
5. A more optimized approach for small character sets could use a fixed-size array instead of a hash map
6. Another approach would be to sort both strings and compare them directly, but that would be O(n log n) time complexity
