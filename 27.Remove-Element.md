# 27. Remove Element

## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int k = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[k] = nums[i];
                k++;
            }
        }

        return k;
    }
};
```

## Approach
This solution uses the **two-pointer technique**:

1. **Initialize**: Set `k = 0` as a pointer to track the position for valid elements
2. **Iterate**: Loop through the array with index `i`
3. **Filter**: When `nums[i] != val`, copy it to position `k` and increment `k`
4. **Return**: `k` represents the count of elements not equal to `val`

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - single pass through the array
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - in-place modification, only using constant extra space

## Key Points
- Modifies the array in-place
- Maintains relative order of non-target elements
- Efficient single-pass solution
- No need to worry about elements beyond the first `k` positions
