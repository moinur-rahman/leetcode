# 289. Game of Life

## Problem Description

According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state of the board.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a helper function to count live neighbors and applies the Game of Life rules:

1. Create a temporary copy of the original board
2. For each cell in the board:
   - Count live neighbors using the countNeighbour function
   - Apply the Game of Life rules to determine the new state
3. The countNeighbour function:
   - Examines all 8 adjacent cells
   - Counts only cells that are within the board boundaries and alive
   - Skips the cell itself when counting

### Time Complexity: O(m×n) where m and n are the dimensions of the board

### Space Complexity: O(m×n) for the temporary board copy

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countNeighbour(vector<vector<int>>& board, int x, int y) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int m = board.size();
        int n = board[0].size();
        for (int i = x - 1; i <= x + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = y - 1; j <= y + 1; j++) {
                if (i >= 0 && i < m && j >= 0 && j < n && board[i][j]) {
                    if (i == x && j == y) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    cnt++;
                }
            }
        }

        return cnt;
    }
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        vector<vector<int>> temp = board;

        int m = board.size();
        int n = board[0].size();

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int neighbour = countNeighbour(temp, i, j);
                // cout << i << " " << j << " " << neighbour << endl;

                if (neighbour == 3) {
                    board[i][j] = 1;
                } else if (neighbour >= 3) {
                    board[i][j] = 0;
                } else if (neighbour < 2) {
                    board[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution creates a temporary copy of the board to avoid modifying the original board during neighbor counting
2. The countNeighbour function handles edge cases by checking bounds before counting
3. Notice there's a bug in the rules implementation: cells with exactly 2 neighbors and currently alive should stay alive, but this is not handled in the code
4. A more space-efficient approach could use bit manipulation to store both current and next states in the same board
