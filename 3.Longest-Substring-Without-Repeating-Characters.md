# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a sliding window technique with character counting:

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - i: start of window
   - j: end of window
2. Use a count array to track character frequencies
3. When character repeats:
   - Shrink window from left until duplicate is removed
4. When character is unique:
   - Add character to window
   - Update maximum length if needed
5. Return maximum length found

### Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of string

### Space Complexity: O(1) since we use fixed size array of 200

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int len = s.length();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        vector<int> count(200, 0);
        int ans = 0;

        while (i <= j && j < len) {
            if (count[s[j]]) {
                count[s[i]]--;
                i++;
            } else {
                count[s[j]]++;
                j++;
                ans = max(ans, j - i);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. Uses sliding window with character frequency counting
2. Window expands when new character is found
3. Window shrinks when duplicate character is encountered
4. Count array tracks frequency of each character
5. Maximum length is updated whenever window expands
