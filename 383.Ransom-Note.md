# 383. Ransom Note

## Problem Description

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a frequency counting approach:

1. Create a hash map to count the occurrences of each character in the `magazine` string
2. Iterate through each character in the `ransomNote` string:
   - If the character count in the hash map is zero, return `false`
   - Otherwise, decrement the count for that character
3. If we can process the entire `ransomNote` without returning `false`, return `true`

### Time Complexity: O(m+n) where m and n are the lengths of `ransomNote` and `magazine` respectively

### Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the size of the character set (26 for lowercase English letters)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        unordered_map<char, int> cnt;
        for (int i = 0; i < magazine.length(); i++) {
            cnt[magazine[i]]++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < ransomNote.length(); i++) {
            if (cnt[ransomNote[i]] == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            cnt[ransomNote[i]]--;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution uses a hash map for efficient character frequency counting
2. We only need to return false when we encounter a character in the ransom note that isn't available in the magazine
3. This approach is efficient for the problem constraints, as we only need to process each character once
4. An alternative approach could use an array of size 26 instead of a hash map, since we're only dealing with lowercase letters
