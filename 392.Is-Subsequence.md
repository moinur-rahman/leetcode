# 392. Is Subsequence

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a two-pointer approach:

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - i: points to characters in string s
   - j: points to characters in string t
2. While both pointers are within their string bounds:
   - If characters match, increment both pointers
   - If characters don't match, only increment j
3. If i reaches end of s, we found all characters of s in t

### Time Complexity: O(n) where n is length of string t

### Space Complexity: O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        int aLen = s.length(), bLen = t.length();
        while (i < aLen && j < bLen) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        if (i == aLen) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The order of characters must be maintained
2. Works efficiently for single string queries
3. Can be modified for multiple subsequence queries using preprocessing
4. Empty string is a subsequence of any string
