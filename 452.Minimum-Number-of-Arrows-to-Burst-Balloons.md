# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

## Problem Description

There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` bursts by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart ≤ x ≤ xend`. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.

Given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

## Solution Approach: Greedy Algorithm with Sorting

This solution uses a greedy approach to minimize the number of arrows needed:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Sort balloons by their end positions (and then by start positions in case of ties)
   - Shoot arrows at the end position of balloons to maximize overlap

### Implementation Details

1. Sort all balloons by their end positions
2. Shoot the first arrow at the end position of the first balloon
3. Move to the next balloon and check if the current arrow can burst it:
   - If the arrow position is within the balloon's range, no new arrow needed
   - If the arrow cannot burst the balloon, shoot a new arrow at the end position of this balloon

### Time Complexity: **O(n log n)**

- Dominated by the sorting operation which takes O(n log n)
- The subsequent loop is O(n)

### Space Complexity: **O(log n)**

- O(log n) for the sorting algorithm's call stack
- No additional data structures are used

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    static bool compare(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        return (a[1] < b[1]) || (a[1] == b[1] && a[0] < b[0]);
    }

    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), compare);

        int arrowCount = 1, arrowShot = points[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
            if (arrowShot < points[i][0] || arrowShot > points[i][1]) {
                arrowShot = points[i][1];
                arrowCount++;
            }
        }

        return arrowCount;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution uses a greedy approach by sorting balloons by their end coordinates:

   - This maximizes the number of balloons that can be burst with a single arrow

2. The comparison function handles both primary sorting by end position and secondary sorting by start position

3. The key observation is that we should always shoot at the end position of the current balloon to maximize the chances of hitting subsequent balloons

4. The condition `arrowShot < points[i][0] || arrowShot > points[i][1]` checks if the current arrow position is outside the range of the current balloon

5. Edge case: If the input array is empty, the function will not enter the loop and return 0, which is correct as no arrows are needed
