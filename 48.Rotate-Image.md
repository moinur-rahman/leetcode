# 48. Rotate Image

## Problem Description

Given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

## Solution Approach

The solution rotates the matrix in two steps:

1. Transpose the matrix (swap elements across the main diagonal)
2. Reverse each row

Key points:

1. First loop performs matrix transpose by swapping elements (i,j) with (j,i)
2. Second loop reverses each row by swapping elements from start and end
3. In-place rotation without using extra space
4. Works for any n x n matrix

### Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) where n is the dimension of the matrix

### Space Complexity: O(1) as we modify the matrix in-place

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();

        // Step 1: Transpose matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Reverse each row
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n / 2; j++) {
                swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[i][n - 1 - j]);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution is elegant and efficient, using only basic operations
2. Visualization of the steps:
   - Transpose: Flip the matrix over its main diagonal
   - Reverse rows: Flip each row horizontally
3. No extra space needed as all operations are performed in-place
4. The approach can be understood by visualizing how elements move during each step
5. Understanding this pattern is useful for similar matrix transformation problems
