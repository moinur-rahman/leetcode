# 49. Group Anagrams

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a hash map to group strings that are anagrams of each other:

1. **Hash Map Strategy**:

   - Use a hash map where the key is the sorted version of each string.
   - All anagrams will have the same sorted string, making it an effective key.
   - Each key's value is a vector of original strings that are anagrams.

2. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Iterate through each string in the input array.
   - Sort each string to create a key.
   - Store the original string in the hash map under this key.
   - Finally, collect all groups from the hash map into the result vector.

### Implementation Details

1. Create an unordered map where keys are sorted strings and values are vectors of anagrams.
2. For each string in the input array:
   - Make a temporary copy of the string and sort it
   - Use this sorted string as a key to group anagrams
3. Convert the hash map to the required output format (vector of vectors).

### Time Complexity: **O(n \* k log k)**

- Where n is the number of strings and k is the maximum length of a string
- Sorting each string takes O(k log k)
- We do this for n strings

### Space Complexity: **O(n \* k)**

- Storage for the hash map and result

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> mp;
        vector<vector<string>> ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < strs.size(); i++) {
            string temp = strs[i];

            sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());

            mp[temp].push_back(strs[i]);
        }

        for (auto it : mp) {
            ans.push_back(it.second);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. This solution efficiently groups anagrams using **sorting as a normalization technique**.
2. The hash map provides **O(1) average access time** for adding strings to their respective groups.
3. Alternative approaches could use **character counting** instead of sorting for potentially better performance with long strings.
4. The solution handles **empty strings** and **strings with duplicate characters** correctly.
