# 49. Group Anagrams

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Solution Approach 1: Sorting

The first solution uses a hash map with sorted strings as keys:

1. **Hash Map Strategy**:
   - Use a hash map where the key is the sorted version of each string.
   - All anagrams will have the same sorted string, making it an effective key.
   - Each key's value is a vector of original strings that are anagrams.

### Implementation Details

1. Create an unordered map where keys are sorted strings and values are vectors of anagrams.
2. For each string in the input array:
   - Make a temporary copy of the string and sort it
   - Use this sorted string as a key to group anagrams
3. Convert the hash map to the required output format (vector of vectors).

### Time Complexity: **O(n \* k log k)**

- Where n is the number of strings and k is the maximum length of a string
- Sorting each string takes O(k log k)
- We do this for n strings

### Space Complexity: **O(n \* k)**

- Storage for the hash map and result

## Code Implementation - Approach 1

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> mp;
        vector<vector<string>> ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < strs.size(); i++) {
            string temp = strs[i];

            sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());

            mp[temp].push_back(strs[i]);
        }

        for (auto it : mp) {
            ans.push_back(it.second);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Solution Approach 2: Character Counting

The second solution uses a character frequency counter to create a unique key:

1. **Frequency Counter Strategy**:
   - Instead of sorting, count the frequency of each character in the string.
   - Create a unique key using these frequencies.
   - This avoids the O(k log k) sorting operation.

### Implementation Details

1. Create a count array of size 26 (for lowercase English letters).
2. For each string, count the frequency of each character.
3. Create a unique key string using the counts (with '#' as separators).
4. Group strings with the same key together.

### Time Complexity: **O(n \* k)**

- Where n is the number of strings and k is the maximum length of a string
- We only iterate through each string once
- No sorting is required

### Space Complexity: **O(n \* k)**

- Storage for the hash map and result

## Code Implementation - Approach 2

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> mp;
        vector<vector<string>> ans;

        for (int i = 0; i < strs.size(); i++) {
            vector<int> count(26, 0);
            for (int j = 0; j < strs[i].size(); j++) {
                count[strs[i][j] - 'a']++;
            }

            string key = "";
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                key.push_back('#');
                key.push_back(count[j]);
            }

            mp[key].push_back(strs[i]);
        }

        for (auto it : mp) {
            ans.push_back(it.second);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. **Approach 1** uses **sorting as a normalization technique**, which is intuitive but less efficient.
2. **Approach 2** uses **character counting**, which is more efficient for large strings.
3. Both approaches use hash maps to provide **O(1) average access time** for grouping.
4. The character counting approach is asymptotically faster (O(n*k) vs O(n*k log k)).
5. Both approaches handle **empty strings** and **strings with duplicate characters** correctly.
