# 56. Merge Intervals

## Problem Description

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

## Solution Approach: Sorting and Merging

This solution sorts the intervals by their start times and then merges overlapping intervals:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - By sorting the intervals, we ensure that overlapping intervals are adjacent
   - We can merge intervals in a single pass after sorting

### Implementation Details

1. Sort the intervals based on the start time
2. Initialize the result with the first interval
3. For each remaining interval:
   - If it overlaps with the last interval in our result, merge them by updating the end time
   - If it doesn't overlap, add it to the result as a new interval
4. Return the result array containing merged intervals

### Time Complexity: **O(n log n)**

- Sorting the intervals takes O(n log n) time
- The subsequent linear scan takes O(n) time
- Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity: **O(n)** or **O(log n)**

- O(n) for storing the result array
- O(log n) for the sorting algorithm's auxiliary space (depending on implementation)

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());

        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        int index = 0;
        ans.push_back(intervals[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= ans[index][0] &&
                intervals[i][0] <= ans[index][1]) {
                ans[index][1] = max(ans[index][1], intervals[i][1]);
            } else {
                ans.push_back(intervals[i]);
                index++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution first sorts intervals by their start values to position potentially overlapping intervals adjacent to each other
2. We maintain a result array and merge intervals when the current interval's start time falls within the last interval's range
3. When merging, we update the end time to be the maximum of the current end time and the overlapping interval's end time
4. If no overlap is found, we simply add the new interval to our result
5. The index variable keeps track of the last interval in our result array, which is the one we might need to merge with
