# 57. Insert Interval

## Problem Description

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the ith interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

## Solution Approach: Linear Scan and Merge

This solution uses a straightforward approach to insert the new interval:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Process intervals in three phases: before overlap, during overlap, and after overlap
   - No need to sort since the input is already sorted by start time

### Implementation Details

1. Add all intervals that end before the new interval starts (no overlap)
2. Merge the new interval with any overlapping intervals by:
   - Taking the minimum of the start times
   - Taking the maximum of the end times
3. Add the merged interval to the result
4. Add all remaining intervals (which start after the new interval ends)

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- We only need a single pass through the intervals array
- No sorting required as the input is already sorted

### Space Complexity: **O(n)**

- O(n) for storing the result array in the worst case

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals,
                               vector<int>& newInterval) {

        vector<vector<int>> ans;

        int i = 0;

        int n = intervals.size();
        while (i < n && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) {
            ans.push_back(intervals[i++]);
        }

        while (i < n && intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) {
            newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]);
            newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        ans.push_back(newInterval);

        while (i < n) {
            ans.push_back(intervals[i++]);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution divides the problem into three distinct phases:

   - Phase 1: Add all intervals that come before the new interval (no overlap)
   - Phase 2: Merge the new interval with any overlapping intervals
   - Phase 3: Add all intervals that come after the merged interval

2. The key criteria for overlapping intervals:

   - Two intervals overlap if the start of one interval is less than or equal to the end of another interval
   - In this solution, we check if `intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]` to identify intervals that overlap with our new interval

3. The merging process updates both the start and end of the new interval to ensure it covers all overlapping intervals

4. Since the input intervals are already sorted, we can process them in a single linear scan
