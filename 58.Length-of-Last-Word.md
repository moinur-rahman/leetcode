# 58. Length of Last Word

## Problem Description

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

## Approach

1. Start from the end of the string
2. Skip trailing spaces
3. Count characters until we hit a space or the beginning of the string
4. Return the count as the length of the last word

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int len = s.length();

        int i = len - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && s[i] == ' ') {
            i--;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        while (i >= 0 && s[i] != ' ') {
            ans++;
            i--;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Examples

- Input: s = "Hello World"
  Output: 5
  Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

- Input: s = " fly me to the moon "
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

- Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
  Output: 6
  Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
