# 71. Simplify Path

## Problem Description

Given a string `path`, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:

1. The path starts with a single slash '/'.
2. Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
3. The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
4. The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')

## Solution Approach: Stack-based Path Normalization

This solution uses a stack to keep track of directory names and handle special directory references:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Use a stack to store valid directory names
   - Handle special cases: "." (current directory) and ".." (parent directory)

### Implementation Details

1. Parse the path by splitting at '/' characters
2. Process each directory name:
   - Ignore empty strings and "." (current directory)
   - If ".." is encountered, pop from the stack (if not empty)
   - Otherwise, push the directory name onto the stack
3. Construct the canonical path from the stack contents

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- We iterate through the path once, performing O(1) operations for each character

### Space Complexity: **O(n)**

- In the worst case, the stack could contain all directories in the path

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
      vector<string> folder;

    string s = "";
    for (int i = 0; i <= path.size(); i++)
    {
        if (path[i] == '/' || i == path.size())
        {
            if (s.size() && s != ".")
            {
                folder.push_back(s);
            }
            s = "";
        }
        else
        {
            s += path[i];
        }
    }

    string ans = "";
    stack<string> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < folder.size(); i++)
    {

        if (folder[i] == "..")
        {
            if (!st.empty())
            {
                st.pop();
            }
        }
        else
        {
            st.push(folder[i]);
        }
    }

    while (!st.empty())
    {
        ans = '/' + st.top() + ans;
        st.pop();
    }

    if (ans.size())
    {
        return ans;
    }
    else
    {
        return "/";
    }
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution handles several key edge cases:

   - Empty path: Returns "/"
   - Multiple consecutive slashes: Treated as a single slash
   - Path with "." directories: These are ignored
   - Path with ".." directories: These remove the previous directory

2. First parsing stage:

   - Split the path into directory names, ignoring "." and empty segments (consecutive slashes)
   - Store valid directory names in a vector

3. Second processing stage:

   - Use a stack to build the normalized path
   - Handle ".." by removing the top directory from the stack (if not empty)
   - Add all other valid directory names to the stack

4. Final construction:
   - Build the path by prepending each directory with a slash
   - Handle the edge case of an empty result by returning "/"
