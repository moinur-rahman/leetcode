# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes

## Problem Description

Given an `m x n` integer matrix, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`. You must do it in place.

## Solution Approach

### Approach 1: Using Two Auxiliary Arrays

This approach uses two arrays to track rows and columns that need to be set to zero.

1. Initialize two arrays:
   - `row[m]` to track rows that need to be set to zero.
   - `col[n]` to track columns that need to be set to zero.
2. Traverse the matrix:
   - If `matrix[i][j] == 0`, mark `row[i] = 1` and `col[j] = 1`.
3. Iterate again through the matrix:
   - If `row[i] == 1` or `col[j] == 1`, set `matrix[i][j] = 0`.

### Time Complexity: O(m * n)
### Space Complexity: O(m + n)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();

        vector<int> row(m, 0), col(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    row[i] = 1;
                    col[j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (row[i] == 1 || col[j] == 1) {
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. This solution modifies the matrix in place.
2. The additional space used is `O(m + n)`, which can be improved to `O(1)` by using the first row and first column of the matrix itself for tracking.
3. Another approach can optimize this further using constant space by marking the first row and column as indicators.
