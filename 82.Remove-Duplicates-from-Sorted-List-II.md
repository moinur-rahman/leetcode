# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

## Problem Description

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

## Solution Approach: Dummy Node and Runner Technique

This solution uses a dummy node and a runner technique to identify and skip over duplicate nodes:

1. **Key Insight**:
   - Use a dummy node to handle edge cases (like head being removed)
   - Track current position and next potential position
   - Skip sequences of identical values

### Implementation Details

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Create a dummy node pointing to head and a current pointer
2. **Scan the List**: For each node, check if its value is duplicated
3. **Skip Duplicates**: When duplicates are found, skip the entire sequence
4. **Maintain Links**: Connect the current node directly to the next distinct value

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- Where n is the length of the linked list
- Single pass through the list

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- Only uses a constant amount of extra space

## Solution: Dummy Node Approach

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode* curr = dummy;
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            ListNode* nextNode = curr->next;

            while (nextNode != nullptr && nextNode->next != nullptr &&
                   nextNode->val == nextNode->next->val) {
                nextNode = nextNode->next;
            }

            if (curr->next != nextNode) {
                curr->next = nextNode == nullptr ? nullptr : nextNode->next;
            } else {
                curr = curr->next;
            }
        }
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

## Notes

1. The solution handles all edge cases:
   - Works on empty lists
   - Works when all elements are duplicates
   - Works when duplicates appear at the beginning or end
2. Using a dummy node simplifies edge cases:
   - Avoids special handling when removing the head
   - Provides a consistent starting point for traversal
3. Algorithm explanation:
   - When curr->next equals nextNode, it means no duplicates were found
   - When curr->next doesn't equal nextNode, we've found duplicates and need to skip them
   - We advance nextNode until we find the last occurrence of a duplicate value
   - Then we connect curr to the node after the last duplicate
