# 86. Partition List

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x. Preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each partition.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses two separate linked lists:

1. One for nodes with values less than x
2. Another for nodes with values greater than or equal to x

Once we've traversed the original list, we connect the "small" list to the "big" list to form the final partitioned list.

### Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list

### Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use constant extra space

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* partition(ListNode* head, int x) {
        ListNode* small = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* big = new ListNode(0);

        ListNode* smallHead = small;
        ListNode* bigHead = big;

        while (head != nullptr) {
            if (head->val >= x) {
                big->next = head;
                big = big->next;
            } else {
                small->next = head;
                small = small->next;
            }
            head = head->next;
        }

        small->next = bigHead->next;
        big->next = nullptr;

        return smallHead->next;
    }
};
```

## Implementation Details

1. Create two dummy nodes to keep track of two separate lists
2. Traverse the original list and append each node to either the "small" or "big" list
3. Connect the tail of the "small" list to the head of the "big" list
4. Set the next pointer of the "big" list's tail to nullptr to avoid cycles
5. Return the head of the merged list (first node after the dummy "small" head)

## Key Insights

- Using dummy nodes simplifies edge cases, especially when dealing with the head of the list
- The order within each partition remains unchanged, preserving the relative ordering
- The algorithm completes in a single pass through the original list
- Memory allocation is efficient with no additional nodes created beyond the dummy heads
