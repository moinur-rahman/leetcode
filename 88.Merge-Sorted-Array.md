# 88. Merge Sorted Array

## Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a three-pointer approach working backwards from the end of the arrays:

1. Start from the last valid elements of both arrays (`m-1` and `n-1`)
2. Compare elements and place the larger one at the end of `nums1`
3. Move backwards through both arrays until all elements from `nums2` are merged

The key insight is to merge from the end to avoid overwriting elements in `nums1` that haven't been processed yet.

### Time Complexity: O(m + n) where m and n are the lengths of the two arrays

### Space Complexity: O(1) as we merge in-place without using extra space

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        int i = m - 1, j = n - 1, k = m + n - 1;

        while (j >= 0) {
            if (i >= 0 && nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                nums1[k] = nums1[i];
                i--;
            } else {
                nums1[k] = nums2[j];
                j--;
            }
            k--;
        }
    }
};
```

## Implementation Details

1. Initialize three pointers: `i` for the last valid element in `nums1`, `j` for the last element in `nums2`, and `k` for the last position in the final merged array
2. Continue while there are still elements in `nums2` to be processed (`j >= 0`)
3. Compare the current elements pointed by `i` and `j`:
   - If `nums1[i]` is larger, place it at position `k` and decrement `i`
   - Otherwise, place `nums2[j]` at position `k` and decrement `j`
4. Decrement `k` after each placement
5. The loop terminates when all elements from `nums2` are merged

## Key Insights

- Merging from the end prevents overwriting unprocessed elements in `nums1`
- The condition `i >= 0` ensures we don't access invalid indices when `nums1` is exhausted
- When `j` reaches -1, all elements from `nums2` have been merged, and remaining elements in `nums1` are already in their correct positions
- No additional space is needed since we're modifying `nums1` in-place
- The algorithm handles edge cases naturally (empty arrays, one array being much larger than the other)
